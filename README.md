Simple java contact example

This project needs someone (_I wonder who?_) to create a `ContactList` class that will hold contacts that
are entered in via the menu.

# Pre-requisites

1. Maven - https://maven.apache.org/install.html
1. Git - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
1. Your favorite editor (IntelliJ is recommended https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)

# Get started

1. Fork this repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Open the project in your editor
    1. For IntelliJ browse to where you cloned the repository and open it up

# Implement missing code

You will need to create a class `ContactList` that will be used to implement the missing behavior.

The `ContactList` will need to be able to:

1. Save a contact
1. Lookup a contact by name
1. Delete a contact
